# BrowserCheck
## Generic malicious browser check written in C Sharp
This is designed to target Windows 7 systems with .NET Framework 3.5 installed by default, but the target .NET Framework can be changed as you see fit. **Note:** If you plan to target other operating systems and .NET Framework versions, the system you are implanting **MUST** have that target framework installed!

**Note To The User:** You will want to add in the logo of the company you are targeting, as well change the footer to match the company you are targeting. This program was designed to be a stager for CobaltStrike and PowerShell Empire implants. Please download the Visual Studio project files and modify using Visual Studio.
