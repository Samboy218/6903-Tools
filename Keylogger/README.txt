This keylogger works on any Windows machine and cannot be detected by any anti-virus software (e.g., Windows Defender).

Rename the file 'Keylogger' to 'Keylogger.exe' or something else. Make sure that the extension (*.exe) is there.
Run the executable.
Your keylogger should be running now as a background process.
Type anything on your keyboard.
A file named 'mylog.txt' should be created in the same directory as the executable.
To close the keylogger, open the task manager.
In the process list, find the process named 'Keylogger.exe' and kill it.
Make sure that no other keystrokes are logged into the log file.
