This is a tool to take a screenshot of the desktop of a Windows machine.

Rename the file ScreenCap to ScreenCap.exe.
Run the file.
The program takes one screenshot (We can easily change it to run for some time and capture screenshots time to time).
Make sure that there is a file named 'testScreenCap.jpg'.
Make sure that the file has the screenshot of your entire desktop.
