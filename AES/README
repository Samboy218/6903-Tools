Title:        AES.py

Author:       Will Johnson

Verson:       0.1

Tool:         AES.py

Prerequisits: Python2 or Python3

Installation: No special steps are needed after downlaod

Testing:      Run AES.py passing it two arguments: a message and a key respectively
              The key MUST be 16 characters long.  The message must be less than
              one quadrillion characters long.

Description:  This tool is designed to encrypt end to end messages for a remote
              Access Terminal using AES.  Two assumptions have been made within
              this tool: matrix substitution, and key expansion.  They are 
              easily replaced to add uniqueness and computational complexity.  
              For the sake of this, they have both been left very simple, and
              relatively computationally weak.  To Encrypt any message, follow
              these steps:
              
              import AES.py
              ct = AES.Encrypt(<your message>, <your key>)

              To Decrypt, follow these steps:

              pt = AES.Decrypt(<your ciphertext>, <your key>)

              ct and pt will both be of type string.  CT will automatically be
              converted to a base 16 representation to save space.
